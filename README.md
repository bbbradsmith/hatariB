  * All gamepad assignments can be configured in the core options. Buttons can be assigned to press keys, or perform other actions besides the default.
* File formats:
  * Floppy disk: ST, MSA, DIM, STX (can be inside ZIP or GZ)
  * Muli-disk: M3U, M3U8
  * TOS ROM: TOS, IMG, ROM, BIN
  * Cartridge: IMG, ROM, BIN, CART
  * Hard disk: (no standard file extensions)
  * TOS, Cartridge, and Hard disk files should be placed in **system/hatarib/**.
  * When loading multiple disks, the best method is to use M3U playlists to specify all needed disks at once during *Load Content*. Information: [M3U file tutorial](https://docs.retroachievements.org/Multi-Disc-Games-Tutorial/).
  * *Load New Disk* can add additional disks while running, but has several caveats, especially regarding savestates. See below.
  * The first two disks of an M3U list will be loaded into drive A and B at startup, 
  * Libretro only has an interface for one disk drive, but you can use the Select button to switch between whether the Disc Control menu currently shows drive A or drive B.
* Hard Disks:
  * *GemDOS* type hard disks can select a subdirectory within *system/hatarib/* to use as a simulated drive.
  * A *GemDOS* folder can represent multiple paritions by having its base directory contain only single-letter folder names representing drive letters. *C/*, *D/*, etc.
  * *ASCI*, *SCSI* and *IDE* hard disks use a binary image file chosen from *system/hatarib/*.
  * *Hard disks are read-only by default for safety. This can be disabled in the *System > Hard Disk Write Protect* core option.
* Saving:
  * When a modified floppy disk is ejected, or the core is closed, a modified copy of that disk image will be written to the *saves/* folder.
  * Whenever a new floppy disk is added (*Load Content*, or *Load New Disk*), the saved copy will be substituted for the original if it exists. (Also, if you want to return to the original disk, you can delete it from *saves/*.)
  * If the *System > Save Floppy Disks* core option is disabled, only the original copy of the file will be used, and the *saves/* folder will not be accessed. However, the modified disk images will still persist in memory for the duration of the session, until you close the content.
  * Only the two currently inserted disks are included in savestates. If there are other disks in your loaded collection, they may take on their most recent version from the saves/ folder next time you open this content. A savestate will not be able to restore them to an earlier version.
  * Floppy disks in *saves/* must have a unique filename. Try not to use generic names like *savedisk.st*, and instead include the game title in its filename.
  * If possible, it is recommended that save disks for games use the *ST* format, because it is the simplest and least error prone format. You can download a prepared blank disk here: **[blank.st](../../raw/main/blank.st)**.
  * The images written to *saves/* will be standard Atari ST image formats, and you should be able to load them in other emulators if you wish.
  * Note that Hatari is not able to simulate the formatting of a blank disk in-emulator. The [stand-alone version of Hatari](https://hatari.tuxfamily.org/download.html) has a utility in its menu that can be used to create a blank ST file. A different Atari ST emulator [Steem.SSE](https://sourceforge.net/projects/steemsse/) can simulate the formatting process.
  * In the core options *Advanced > Write Protect Floppy Disks* will act as if all inserted disks have their write protect tab open. This means the emulated operating system will refuse to write any further data to the disk, and will report the error. This is independent of the save feature, and can be turned on and off at will. Turning it on after a disk is modified will not prevent previous modifications from being saved when it is ejected.
  * *STX* saves will create a *WD1772* file instead of an *STX* when saved. This is an overlay of changes made to the file, because the STX format itself cannot be re-written. If you wish to use these with the stand-alone Hatari, place the overlay file in the same folder as its STX.
  * *DIM* format disks cannot be saved by Hatari. It is recommended to convert them to *ST* files instead.
  * Hard Disk folders or images in *system/* will be written to directly when they are modified.
  * The TT and Falcon machines have a small non-volatile RAM (NVRAM) that stores system settings. This is saved to **system/hatarib.nvram** when the content is closed.
* TOS ROMs:
  * The TOS ROM can be chosen in the core option *Sstem > TOS ROM*.
  * The default TOS ROM is *system/tos.img*, but *[EmuTOS 1024k](https://emutos.sourceforge.io/)* is provided as a free substitute.
  * Additional TOS ROMs can be supplied in *system/hatarib/*, up to a limit of 100 files.
  * *EmuTOS* is compatible with most software, but not all. In most incompatibility cases it will show a "Panic" message at boot.
  * *EmuTOS 1024k* is the default, with a full feature set, and univeral support for all emulated machine types.
  * *EmuTOS 192uk* may be slightly more compatible with *ST* software, but provides fewer features. With a colour monitor it starts up in 50hz by default.
  * *EmuTOS 192us* is similar to *192uk* but instead starts in 60hz.
  * Most other TOS files are only compatible with certain machines.
* On-Screen Keyboard
  * An on-screen keyboard can be used to simulate using the Atari's keyboard from your gamepad.
  * Press L1 to raise the on-screen keyboard, select a key with the d-pad, and press L1 again to press the key. Press R1 to close the keyboard.
  * Press L2 to raise the keyboard in one-shot mode, which pauses emulation and will resume immediately when you press L1 or R2.
  * To alternate between a top and bottom keyboard position, press X.
  * Modifier keys like Shift, Control, Alt are toggled instead of a single press, allowing you to hold the modifier while you press another key. When you close the keyboard, all modifiers will be released.
  * The keyboard language layout can be chosen in the *Input > On-Screen Keyboard Language* core option.
* Accuracy:
  * Some of the default core options are chosen to favour lower CPU usage, and faster load times, but these can be adjusted.
  * *System > Fast Floppy* gives artificially faster disk access, on by default.
  * *System > Patch TOS for Fast Boot* modifies known TOS images to boot faster, on by default.
  * *System > CPU Prefetch Emulation* - Emulates memory prefetch, needed for some games. On by default.
  * *System > Cycle-exact Cache Emulation* - Very accurate cache emulation, not usually needed for compatibility. Off by default.
  * See the *Advanced* category for other relevant options.
* Savestates:
  * Savestates are seamless, allowing run-ahead and netplay in theory, but the restore action is very CPU intensive and may cause stuttering in the live output.
  * *Load New Disk* has several caveats with savesates:
      * RetroArch will change the savestate name to match the newest loaded disk, so be sure that you know that savestates associated with that disk.
      * To restore in a later session, start the core as you did before and use *Load New Disk* to add all needed disks before attempting to restore the savestate. The last disk loaded must be the same as before, so that the savestate name will match correctly.
      * In rare cases, inserting a unusually large new disk may increase the needed savestate size and cause a failure to save. You can eject the disk and try reducing the savestate size before trying again. (RetroArch has a limitation that savestate size must be fixed, determined at Load Content time.)
      * It is generally recommended to use M3U playlists instead of *Load New Disk* when possible ([tutorial](https://docs.retroachievements.org/Multi-Disc-Games-Tutorial/)).
  * Hard Disk modifications are written directly to their source files, and are not included in savestates.
  * If you increase the size of memory, you should close and restart the core before using savestates, to allow RetroArch to update the savestate size.
* Quirks:
  * We cannot delete directories in a GemDOS hard disk, because of [a bug in the RetroArch virtual file system](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues/15578) that affects windows only. This will likely be fixed in the future by an update to RetroArch. There's a working fallback if the VFS isn't provided by the host, but this isn't something easily accessible by the user, and the VFS provides other advantages so it should not be turned off. You can work around this by deleting the folder on your host computer instead.
  * For some invalid combinations of TOS + Machine, Hatari will automatically change the machine with a notice. In this state, changing any option in the config menu will reset the system. Haven't figured out the best way to fix this because Hatari was designed to modify your stored settings directly in this case.
  * Changing any core option will also reset CPU speed, which could be a problem for Falcon that can change it at runtime (does anyone know a good software test case?), same settings modification issue as above.
  * There may be other run-state like these stored directly as configuration modifications that will be clobbered by core options changes. Still evaluating the scope of this problem. (I don't want the core secretly changing settings without the user knowing.)
  * Restoring a savestate, or using netplay/run-ahead into the pause or one-shot keyboard will have an outdated/blank background until unpaused, as Hatari can't rebuild the image until it runs a frame. We might consider fixing this by adding the framebuffer to the savestate, though it would significantly increase the data size.
  * If the on-screen keyboard confirm/cancel buttons aren't mapped to dedicated keys, you might end up suddenly holding the underlying button when the keyboard closes.
  * The Floppy Disk List pause screen won't display unicode filenames correctly.
  * You can use Load New Disk or M3U playlists to load the same floppy multiple times, or multiple floppies with the same name. This mostly works okay, but a savestate restore might be unable to identify which of them was actually inserted.
* MacOS:
  * This platform is a bit harder to set up, and currently requires a few extra steps.
    * After downloading the core, right click on `cores/hatarib.dylib` and open it, you will have to allow it to have permission to run.
    * Download `libSDL2.dylib` [here](https://github.com/OutOfOrder/SDL2-Binaries/tree/master/osx), rename it to `libSDL2-2.0.0.dylib` and then copy it to `/usr/local/opt/sdl2/lib/`? Again, right click on it and open it to allow permissions.
    * Once this is done it seems to open correctly in RetroArch. I think a longer term solution will require getting rid of the SDL2 dynamic linking requirement, w

Possible Future Tasks:
* Investigate Libretro MIDI interface. I wonder if I could play MIDI Maze against my real ST?
* Can savestate restore be more lightweight? What takes so much CPU time? Are there any lingering spurious disk accesses?
* RS232 emulation?
* Printer emulation?
* IPF support, figure out library issues. There seems to be a MAME IPF reader?
* Keyboard languages and layouts? Need to know a bit more about how to test this. Think about host keyboard vs. simulated keyboard, etc.
* Look for Log cases where Hatari changes CFG (most of these are in tos.c) and turn them into a halt instead of automatically changing system. Setting CPU speed should probably only be applied at cold boot? (Put a "requires restart" notice on it.)
* Remove SDL2 dynamic linking requirement. Import only the subset of SDL2 needed for this integration into this project and build it directly in.
