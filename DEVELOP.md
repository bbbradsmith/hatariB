## Prerequisites

This has been built and tested with MSYS2 UCRT64. The following packages are required:

* gcc (mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc)
* make
* cmake (mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cmake)
* SDL2 (mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-SDL2)
* zlib (mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-zlib)

## Changes to Hatari

Changes to the C source code are all contained in `__LIBRETRO__` defines. This is important for merging future versions. None of the original code has been modified or deleted, only disabled within `#ifdef` blocks.

Otherwise there are minor changes to the CMake build files, marked with a comment that beings with: `# hatariB`

* **hatari/CMakeLists.txt**
  * Add `-fPIC` compiler option to generate relocatable code for shared object use.
  * Removed `HAVE_STATVFS` check because we use the Libretro VFS instead.
  * Disable `ALERT_HOOKS` not needed for MacOS build without GUI.
  * Disable `tests` which require an executable version of Hatari to be built.
* **hatari/src/CMakeLists.txt**
  * Removed OS-specific libraries, and `hatari` executable build target.
  * Added `core` library target with `__LIBRETRO__` define.
  * `add_library(core ${SOURCES})`
* **hatari/src/cpu/CMakeLists.txt**
* **hatari/src/debug/CMakeLists.txt**
* **hatari/src/falcon/CMakeLists.txt**
* **hatari/src/gui-sdl/CMakeLists.txt**
  * Define `__LIBRETRO__`for all internal hatari libraries.
  * target_compile_definitions(xxx PUBLIC __LIBRETRO__)`
* **hatari/src/tools/CMakeLists.txt**
  * Disabled `hmsa` support tool build (not needed, can't like with changes to floppy system).
* Use `-DENABLE_SMALL_MEM=0` and `-DENABLE_TRACING=0` to slightly improve performance.
  * Note that ENABLE_SMALL_MEM can save ~14-15MB of RAM, so it might be worthwhile for platforms with smaller memory.

* **hatari/src/includes/main.h**
  * Added common include `../../core/core.h` to give quick common access to hatariB core.
* **hatari/src/main.c**
  * Split `main` into `main_init`, and `main_deinit`.
  * Skip `Win_OpenCon` and `setenv`.
  * `Main_WaitOnVbl` now sets `SPCFLAG_BRK` to exit the CPU run loop on each simulated vblank.
  * Always assume perfect frame timing rather than measuring system time and manually delaying.
  * Replace SDL event queue polling with a simulated input event queue from the Libretro core. Limit only to key/mouse input events.
  * Don't SDL_Init or SDL_Quit, SDL is not used except for creating the software texture, which does not require init. (SDL_Quit will conflict with some versions of RetroArch SDL2 input drivers and crash on close.)
  * Disable `Main_WarpMouse` because Libretro will capture the mouse with its focus mode.
  * Replace default status bar help message with a note to press Scroll-Lock for focus mode.
  * Replace loading config from file with core configuration.
  * Allow missing TOS file to pass through initialization so we can halt the CPU and report the error to the user later.
* **hatari/src/cpu/newcpu.c**
  * Split `m68k_go` into `m68k_go`, `m68k_go_frame` and `m68k_go_quit`.
  * Add `core_init_return` to exit after CPU initialization but before first cycles run.
  * Exit the run loop just after `savestate_restore_final` to allow resume from restored point at next `retro_run`.
  * Edited `m68k_disasm_file` hardcoded `TraceFile` to use `LOG_TRACE_PRINT` instead so it can redirect to libretro.
* **hatari/src/screen.c**
  * Don't create or use window or SDL renderer, avoid sending renderer hints.
  * Use existing SDL software surface, but send its data to the core (`core_video_update`) instead of using a renderer present.
  * Use SDL software rendering to support all 3 pixel formats allowed by Libretro.
  * Don't SDL_Quit on error.
  * Add option for low resolution pixel doubling.
  * Clear to current ST palette 0 instead of black (looks nicer while palette is paused).
* **hatari/src/resolution.c**
  * Don't use SDL_GetDesktopDisplayMode to get resolution.
* **hatari/src/video.c**
  * Notify core of video framerate changes.
  * Suppress unused-variable warnings due to `ENABLE_TRACING`.
* **hatari/src/audio.c**
  * Disable SDL audio initialization, but report Audio_Init as successful to enable audio generation.
  * Notify core of audio samplerate changes.
* **hatari/src/sound.c**
  * Send generated audio to core in `Sound_Update`.
  * Save `YM_Buffer` to savestates for seamless audio across savestates/runahead.
  * Added IIR lowpass filter option for lower audio distortion.
  * Fixed broken lowpass filter implementation which was running at 250kHz instead of 44/48kHz.
* **hatari/src/joy.c**
  * Disable SDL josyick initialization.
  * Use core-provided joystick state instead.
* **hatari/src/memorySnapShot.c**
  * Replaced snapshot file access with a core-provided in-memory buffer.
  * Disable snapshot compression because Libretro needs it uncompressed.
  * Make `bCaptureError` externally accessible to check for errors after restore.
  * Disable some `Log_AlertDlg`s to prevent spam.
* **hatari/src/hatari-glue.c**
  * Add `core_save_state` and `core_restore_state` to execute savestates between `retro_run` calls.
  * Add `core_flush_audio` to reset audio queue when needed.
* **hatari/src/tos.c**
  * Allow built-in TOS bios (EmuTOS).
  * Use core_file to load the TOS image.
  * Keep a cached copy of last used TOS to prevent reloading the file on restore.
  * Allow missing TOS to proceed, signal failure to core to be reported there later.
* **hatari/src/cart.c**
  * Use core_file to load the cartridge image.
* **hatari/src/debug/log.h**
* **hatari/src/debug/log.c**
  * Redirect `Log_Printf` to libretro debug log (optional define for debug).
  * Redirect `LOG_TRACE` and `LOG_TRACE_PRINT` to libretro debug log.
  * Disable blocking `DlgAlert_Notice`, send to onscreen notification and error log instead.
* **hatari/src/reset.c**
  * Signal the core when a reset happens so it can be handled properly.
* **hatari/src/gui-sdl/dlgHalt.c**
  * Disable blocking `Dialog_HaltDlg`, replace with a signal to the core to halt its own emulation.
* **hatari/src/configuration.c**
* **hatari/src/includes/configuration.h**
  * Add option for built-in TOS bios (EmuTOS).
  * Add option for low resolution pixel doubling.
  * Add options for YM filter configuration.
  * Override some of the default options.
  * Don't use SDL_NumJoysticks.
* **hatari/src/keymap.c**
  * Block Scroll Lock from generating keypresses (probably not possible in RetroArch anyway).
  * Disable all Hatari shortcut keys.
  * Disable Hatari key to joystick mappings.
  * Provide modifier key state instead of `SDL_GetModState`. (Eventually just removed it, it's only for num-lock.)
  * Disable Num Lock condition for keypad use (Atari ST has no num-lock).
  * Fix broken mappings for `-_`, `[{`, `]}` and `~` keys.
* **hatari/src/change.c**
  * Signal screen change when Low Resolution pixel doubling option changes.
  * Save/Reload NvRam when machine changes, only if TT or Falcon.
* **hatari/src/cpu/memory.c**
  * Don't SDL_Quit on error.
* **hatari/src/floppy.c**
* **hatari/src/includes/floppy.h**
  * Load floppy images from memory instead of from file.
  * Read back inserted floppy filenames after savestate restore.
  * Mark disks potentially changed by savestates for re-save.
  * Disable check for filesystem write protect on floppy images, not available to libretro core.

  * Disable unnecessary`Log_AlertDlg` warning that STX files save to overlay.
* **hatari/src/midi.c**

  * Disabled unneeded uses of unzip.
* **hatari/src/statusbar.c**
  * Double size of LED light.
  * Fix LED render corruption after resolution change.

`SDL_Init` and `SDL_Quit` almost all use of the SDL library have been suppressed. There are some remaining uses of the SDL libraries but I do not believe any of them require Init. These include:
* SDL ending defines and utilities (e.g. `SDL_SwapLE16`) which are used throughout.
* `SDL_CreateRGBSurface` to create `SDL_SWSURFACE` only. I do not believe this relies on `INIT_VIDEO` (which would have the collateral of `INIT_EVENTS` etc.).
* `statusbar.c` and `gui-dsl/sdlgui.c` draw to the surface, using `SDL_FillRect`, `SDL_BlitSurface`, `SDL_LockSurface`, etc. which I believe are all fine without `INIT_VIDEO`.
